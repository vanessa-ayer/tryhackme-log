> A fun retro terminal-style Jekyll theme inspired by TryHackMe missions (now serving as a **design demo** for cybersecurity blogs.)

Originally created to track my progress on TryHackMe, but this project has evolved into a **visual design demo** showing how a cybersecurity themed blog can look and feel inside a simulated retro console environment.

Key highlights:  
-  Animated typing effects on headers and links  
-  Dynamic **Rank bar** (configurable in `_config.yml`)  
-  Soft terminal dark theme with neon glow  
-  Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and Jekyll (no frameworks)
