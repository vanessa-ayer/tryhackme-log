This week I started my **TryHackMe Pre-Security path**, and I’m completely hooked. What started as curiosity about cybersecurity has turned into a full-on grind to complete each room successfully.  
Every challenge feels like leveling up in a game, and today’s quest, **“What is Networking”** was such a fun introduction to how devices communicate across the Internet.  
I wrapped up the room feeling like I just unlocked the first big piece of the puzzle, and honestly, I’m obsessed.

Here’s what I learned:

Room: [What is Networking?](https://tryhackme.com/room/whatisnetworking)  
Path: Pre-Security
**Goal:** Explore how computers, routers, and other devices communicate to form the networks we use every day.

<h2>$ mission log <span class="cursor"></span></h2>

Networking keeps the digital world alive. Every message, stream, and file is just **data moving between devices** using shared rules (protocols).

This room broke it down simply: **devices (nodes)** send **packets** that travel through **routers** and other gear to reach a **destination**.  
Seeing the flow made networking click for me:

```bash

My_Computer --> Home_Router --> Internet --> Remote_Server --> Back_to_Me

```
